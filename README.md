# open-closed-prediction-cho-chan
Project C for Winter 2026
Goal: Build a model that predicts if a place is open or closed
How: Use a place’s attributes and comparison to other sources to check if a place is open or not; 
Keep in mind the solution must scale for >100M places
Data: Use a pre-labeled sample of ~5k places to train a model
